# 3D RU-Net

Code for the paper entitled "3D RoI-aware U-Net for Accurate and Efficient Colorectal Cancer Segmentation".
The latest version of the 3D RU-Net code is implmented with PyTorch, which elegantly realizes the essential part of our algorithm and enables in-place computing.

Here are some results of colorectal cancer segmentation, which is the case of the paper; and illustrations of another task, mandible and masseter segmentation, showing the scalability of the proposed method.
