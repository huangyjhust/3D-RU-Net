# 3D RU-Net

Code for the paper entitled "3D RoI-aware U-Net for Accurate and Efficient Colorectal Cancer Segmentation"(https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10342).

The latest codes are now released. Weights and a preprocessed test fold will be uploaded in a few days.

Here are some results of colorectal cancer segmentation, which is the case of the paper; and illustrations of another task, mandible and masseter segmentation, showing the scalability of the proposed method.

Latest experiment: simultaneously segmenting 14 organs from pelvic CTs in ~0.5s (We trained this model with 24 training samples).
